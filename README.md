  Hello, these are some scripts that I've collected and I find useful, to execute type this into your command line:
loadstring(game:HttpGet('X'))()
  If some don't work, try this:
loadstring(game:HttpGet('X', true))()
  When adding X, make sure to go to one of the scripts and press on raw, copy the link and insert it there fully with the https:// part.
